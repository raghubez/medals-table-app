## Programming Task

## Run the app

1.  yarn install
2.  yarn start

App should be running on localhost:3000

## The Task

1.  Fork this repository on Github
2.  Create a _src_ folder to contain your code;
3.  In the _src_ directory, create a simple app to allow a basic Olympic Medals Table to be displayed in a browser or on a device;
4.  The app should allow:

* Countries to be added to a table, along with the TOTAL number of medals the country won during the last Olympic Games; and
* Rows to be sorted in descending order of medals won, either automatically or manually by the user.

### For bonus points:

If you find the task above easy, then feel free to improve your app. Here are some ideas:

* Add counts for each type of medal (Gold, Silver, Bronze) and make the countries order by Gold first, Silver next and Bronze thereafter;
* Add country flag icons/images to the country names;
* Allow editing and/or deleting of countries from the list.
