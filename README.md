## Programming Task

## The Task

1.  Fork this repository on Github (if you don't know what that means or how to do it, Google is your friend);
2.  Create a _src_ folder to contain your code;
3.  In the _src_ directory, create a simple app to allow a basic Olympic Medals Table to be displayed in a browser or on a device;
4.  The app should allow:

* Countries to be added to a table, along with the TOTAL number of medals the country won during the last Olympic Games; and
* Rows to be sorted in descending order of medals won, either automatically or manually by the user.

5.  Commit and Push your code to your new repository;
6.  Send us a pull request;
7.  Your code will be reviewed by one of our senior technical team and we will get back to you.

If you wish to supply instructions on how to run or understand the construction of your app, then please provide those in a new README.md file within a docs folder.

If you can provide a link to view or download a demo of your app to go along with your code, then all the better.

#### _Feel free to use any combination of technologies, frameworks and techniques you prefer._

### For bonus points:

If you find the task above easy, then feel free to improve your app. Here are some ideas:

* Add counts for each type of medal (Gold, Silver, Bronze) and make the countries order by Gold first, Silver next and Bronze thereafter;
* Add country flag icons/images to the country names;
* Allow editing and/or deleting of countries from the list.
